# The SimplrHTML specification

## What is SimplrHTML?
SimplrHTML, or SHTML, is a new language that is inspired by HTML and Markdown. SHTML is like HTML because uses tags for structure and formating, but the tags are enclosed in square brackets (`[` and `]`) and there are no attributes in SHTML; these differences make SHTML tags easyer to type and escape than HTML tags. SimplrHTML is like Markdoen because it separates paragraphs and other block-level structures using white space, but SHTML is a lot simpler to tokenize and parse than Markdown, meaning that you do not have to learn how to escape different characters.
